//    Use the Product object you created in the last exercise
//
//    Create an object Shop that has a list of products and their inventory count.
//
//    You decide where the count is kept.
//    The name of the product is unique in the Shop (must be validated)
//    The shop exposes method to add product to inventory
//    The shop exposes method that allows you to buy a specific amount of product. In case of not having enough product, you should handle that (exception? partial buy? do nothing? response object?)
//    notes:
//
//    You can create any number of new objects that are not in the text of the problem. Don't forget to put immutability first!
